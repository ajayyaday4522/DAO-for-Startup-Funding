## Project Title
DAO for Startup Funding

## Project Description
This project is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) designed to pool funds and invest in startups through tokenized equity. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, the DAO ensures transparent, community-driven investment decisions while enabling fractional ownership in promising startups.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize startup funding by creating a decentralized, trustless, and transparent investment ecosystem. By utilizing smart contracts, we eliminate intermediaries, reduce inefficiencies, and empower investors to make informed decisions while providing startups with seamless access to capital.

## Future Scope
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Expand the DAO's functionality to support multiple blockchain networks.
- **Automated Governance Enhancements:** Implement AI-driven analytics for better decision-making.
- **Regulatory Compliance Features:** Integrate legal frameworks to comply with jurisdictional regulations.
- **NFT Integration:** Tokenize equity as NFTs for added liquidity and tradability.
- **DeFi Integration:** Enable staking and yield farming mechanisms for additional investor incentives.

## Key Features
